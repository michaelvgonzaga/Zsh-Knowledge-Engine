# Zsh Knowledge Engine (ZKE)
A lightweight, fully offline, zero-dependency system for organizing reusable code, snippets, templates, debugging steps, workflows, and automation directly inside your Zsh environment.
Every .zsh file inside the knowledge base becomes an executable function loaded automatically by Zsh.

# Overview
Instead of scattering notes across apps and documents, the Zsh Knowledge Engine lets you store knowledge as functions you can execute instantly from your terminal.

Perfect for:
- command snippets
- templates
- code scaffolds
- debugging steps
- DevOps helpers
- Workflows
- Chat replies
- Automation
- Mental models
- Personal knowledge

ZKE turns your terminal into a knowledge superpower.

# Features
- Fully offline and private
- Zero dependencies (pure Zsh)
- Auto-loads all .zsh files at startup
- Unlimited folder nesting
- Escape-safe templates using cat << 'EOF'
- Modular and extensible
- Works across multiple repositories
- Fast, lightweight, and portable

# Folder Structure
A ZKE expects at least one .kb folder.

Inside it, create any structure you want:
```sh
.kb/
  devops/
  chat/
  creative/
  web/
    backend/
    frontend/
  platform/
  misc/
```

There is no limit.
Any .zsh file at any depth will be discovered and sourced automatically.

# Installation
You can place your knowledge base anywhere:

- In your home directory
- Inside a project repo (recommended)
- In multiple repos for different contexts (personal, work, etc.)
- Below are the supported patterns.
  * Option 1: Install KB at ~/.kb (default)
    Clone:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo ~/.kb
    ```
 * Option 1:  If not available, add this to your ~/.zshrc:
```sh
   [[ -f "$HOME/.kb/load.zsh" ]] && source "$HOME/.kb/load.zsh"
```

Reload:
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

  * Option 2: KB Inside a Repo (recommended)
    If your .kb folder lives inside a repo like:
    ```sh
    ~/your_folder_name/.kb
    ```
    add this to your ~/.zshrc:
````sh
    # Load Knowledge Base inside this repo
[[ -f "$HOME/your_folder_name/load.zsh" ]] && source "$HOME/your_folder_name/load.zsh"
````
  This way, your knowledge base travels with the repo.

  * Option 3: Multiple Knowledge Bases
    You can load several KBs:
````sh
# Personal KB
[[ -f "$HOME/your_folder_name/load.zsh" ]] && source "$HOME/your_folder_name/load.zsh"
# Work / Platform KB
[[ -f "$HOME/another_folder_name/load.zsh" ]] && source "$HOME/another_folder_name/load.zsh"
````
Zsh will merge all .kb/** contents into your environment.

# Loader (load.zsh)

A universal loader that recursively sources all .zsh files:
````sh
#!/bin/zsh

# Path to this repo’s .kb folder
KB_DIR="$HOME/your_folder_name/.kb"

setopt extendedglob null_glob

# Load all .zsh files at any depth
for file in "$KB_DIR"/**/*.zsh(.N); do
  source "$file"
done
````

If you use multiple KB repos, each repo should have its own load.zsh.

# Creating a Snippet Function

Create a file, e.g.:
```sh
.kb/misc/example.zsh
```

Add:
````sh
kb_example() {
  cat << 'EOF'
This is a multiline, escape-safe snippet.
Quotes: "hello" 'world'
Backslashes: \n \t \\
Dollar signs: $PATH $HOME
EOF
}
````

Use it:
```sh
kb_example
```

$ Listing Available KB Functions

List all loaded ZKE functions:
```sh
typeset -f | grep "^kb_"
```

List all .zsh files in the KB:
```sh
find ~/.kb -type f -name "*.zsh"
```

Or, if your KB is inside a repo:
```sh
find ~/your_folder_name/.kb -type f -name "*.zsh"
```
# Why This Exists
- Most knowledge systems store information in passive notes.
- ZKE stores executable knowledge:
- ready-to-run functions
- repeatable workflows
- reusable templates
- automation-on-demand
- 
It grows with your workflow and becomes a powerful tool for development, operations, learning, and everyday life.
